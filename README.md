# Tip Tracking Dashboard

by Colin Trierweiler

This project is based off of the "Build a Data Dashboard" project at https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-data-dashboard-using-html-css-javascript by Thomas Reid.

I have changed his mock sales data to include the real data of the tips I made last week, plus other data about how many hours I worked, what day of the week it was, and whether the shift was AM or PM.

I think this could be developed into a real app to help servers keep track of their tips, and what days and shifts yield the most.  It's obviously different in every restaurant, but it's a start.

I also changed the CSS to fit my brand (green-text on a black background).

I am releasing it under a GNU General Public License, so others may play with the code as they see fit.
